Sixteen thousand square
Eight million up there, two million down here

When I was born, grandmama could see it
I be Bentley driven and very strategic
R.M. sleeve, no diamonds are needed
Floors are heated, so be it, so be it
Fuckin' with P, get somethin' immediate
Your soul don't like your body, we helped you free it
Then we wait for TMZ to leak it
It ain't no secrets, so be it, so be it

Smoke
So be it, so be it
Smoke
So be it

C-L-I-P-S-E, epi, 8-ball, LV
I can show you how to bust a brick if you let mе
I monogram like confetti, switches rеady
She leanin' on Celine 'cause she ain't steppin' in Giuseppe
Catch a buck-fifty like each Pirelli
I got eight of 'em, call me Andretti
If I'm not in the telly sellin' the yeti
Then I'm twirlin' your bitch like she in spaghetti, heavy
Circle back and come and get this Kelly
And your ears too, if you want 'em blue like Belly
Lotta jettin', Prada beddin', 911s
I'm the who's who with what's what, papa heaven
Fuck around and get your body traced tryna test me
'Cause niggas that I'm with like to draw when it's sketchy
If they catch me, don't forget me, resurrect me
Buy a dog tag the same place that they baguette me, ski

You ain't solid, ain't valid, you ain't Malice
Been quiet, ain't riot, you ain't Paris
Blow money, you owe money, we ain't balanced
You ain't believe, God did, you ain't Khaled
All black, back to back, this ain't traffic
Can't wrap your head 'round that, you ain't Arab
Y'all tweet, bird talk, we all parrots
Lone star, cross the border, we like Dallas
Twenty-one-gun salute, we been savage
Tag 'em up, add 'em up, them niggas average
Fly 'em in, fly 'em out, only the baddest
If I had her, then you had her, she never mattered
Wish upon the stars on my roof, they all scattered
Ain't no more Neptunes, so P's Saturn
Off the first ski-up, they re-up, it's a pattern
Like middle men, they killin' 'em, you know what happened, ski

You cried in front of me, you died in front of me
Calabasas took your bitch and your pride in front of me
Her Utopia had moved right up the street
And her lip gloss was poppin', she ain't need you to eat
The 'net gon' call it the way that they see it
But I got the video, I can share and A.E. it
They wouldn't believe it, but I can't unsee it
Lucky I ain't TMZ it, so be it, so be it
